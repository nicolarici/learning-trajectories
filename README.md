# Learning Trajectories of Figurative Language for Pre-Trained Language Models

This is the official repository for the EMNLP 2025 Findings paper *Learning Trajectories of Figurative Language for Pre-Trained Language Models*.
It provides the source code, datasets, and configuration files necessary to reproduce the experiments and results presented in the paper.

The pubblication is available in the [ACL Anthology](https://aclanthology.org/2025.findings-emnlp.779/).

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

- ```code/```:  source code for all experiments, including configuration examples and the Python environment specification.
- ```datasets/```: four datasets (in JSONL format), each corresponding to a distinct figure of speech.
